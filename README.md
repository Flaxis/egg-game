# Egg game

This is a simple egg game built in phaser

### Installation
Clone the git repository:
```sh
Git clone https://github.com/Flaxis/egg-game.git
```
Install dependencies using npm:
```sh
npm install
```

Finally, set up your development environment to run grunt every time you want to test something. The compiled javascript should end up in app/game.js

The sprites are compiled using [Texture packer]. It is a proprietary application and costs money. If you're contributing to this project, you need sprites compiled and don't want to buy the application, feel free to contact me.

The sprites used are open game graphics from Kenney at [opengameart].

### Contributing

Feel free to add new features / gameplay to the game. We still need:

* Score system; the longer you can stay alive, the higher your score gets
* Death system; when you reach 0 lives, you're game over. At game over, you can replay or share your score on Facebook.
* Title screen with menu options
* Sound and music settings
* Sounds when egg is hit and when egg dies
